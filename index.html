                <blockquote><strong>In this article, I am reviewing “Race-Making and the Nation State” by Anthony W. Marx, which analyses the state’s role in the construction of race. Marx compares the cases of Brazil, South Africa, and the United States. All three went through processes of state configuration in the aftermath of slavery but with very different outcomes. South Africa and the United States emerged with distinct official racial ideologies - the former with Apartheid, the latter with Jim Crow. In contrast, Brazil never created legal distinctions based on race.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Past explanations do not provide a full answer to why Brazil did not institutionalize racism. It is often said that Brazil was more tolerant of its slaves- they were allowed to own private property, marry, and buy their freedom. This rights bely the fact that slaves lives were not necessarily better than those of slaves in other countries. For instance, slave mortality in Brazil was higher than other slave powers due to the harsh conditions slaves were subjected to. 
</p><p></p><div><br></div><div>It is also believed that the high level of miscegenation in Brazil provided for a greater social mobility among races. But in practice only a few could advance socially, this was enough however to create a belief in mobility (Marx, 1996: 187). Moreover, it is been proven that the United States and South Africa were also significantly miscegenated societies, so this is not a differentiating factor between the nations.
</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Economic explanations have suggested that segregation served the interests of Capital by providing cheap black labor, while simultaneously ensuring higher-paid white labor (Marx, 1996: 187). In actuality, racial hierarchies primarily served to provide stability and lessen the potential for class conflict between white people, and led the state to impose racial domination in South Africa and the United States and give privilege to white workers in Brazil. Even if economic development was enhanced by racism, it does not explain the creation of a racial order by itself.

</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After the Boer War in South Africa, segregation of black people became a key tool for reconciling the differences between British and Afrikaners.  In order to create the South African State, white unity became fundamental. It was even further encouraged in 1948 when Apartheid was imposed.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p></p><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A similar thing happened in the US after the Civil War freed the slaves. Despite the fact that black people were now free, the North and the South continued to foster racial domination out of fear of another Southern rebellion (Marx, 1996: 196). The expansion of black people newfound rights was quickly abandoned as Jim Crow segregation was spread throughout the South (Marx, 1996: 196).&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It is true that the cases of South Africa and the United States have deep differences. In the US, rights existed but were not respected. Meanwhile, in South Africa, rights were not guaranteed by the Constitution. However, the outcomes were similar. Conflict among white people was appeased with legal discrimination of black people. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The case of Brazil makes for an interesting comparison. Portuguese colonialism imposed a more direct rule, maintaining unified elites. Therefore, there was no need for official racial discrimination. In order to avoid ethnic conflict during the transition from a colony to a state, an image of inclusiveness was created. Class mobility was encouraged through miscegenation in order to unite and “whiten” the population, counteracting the continued racial inequality (Marx, 1996: 199).</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><p></p></div>

The Costs were suddenly higher than benefits, leading to states removing their discriminatory policies. Apartheid and Jim Crow eventually ended. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Marx concludes that the state is the central actor in race-making. It is the state that categorizes people as black, white, or mulatto, and enforces legal discrimination. Who is included and excluded is not random. Racism was purposefully created in order to stabilize a nation that had groups with potential conflict. Nonetheless, once constructed, race can not be easily dismantled (Marx, 1996, p.207). Mobilization might have forced the nation-state to reconstruct itself is a more inclusive manner, but discrimination still exists today.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>
